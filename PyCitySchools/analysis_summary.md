# analysis_summary

In this project, student grades, school type, and school budget are used as indicators of overall school and district performance.

The following analyses were executed and summarized in DataFrames:
    - Summary of district level performance
    - Summary of individual school performance
    - Student scores by grade across schools
    - Student scores by per capita spending across schools
    - Student scores by school size across schools
    - Average student scores for school size
    - Average student scores by school type


The analyses suggest that students in Charter schools perform better overall than those in District schools. This may be due to the fact that District schools are generally larger and have more students than Charter schools, where the smaller size of Charter schools may allow more students to receive individual attention from teachers. Students at schools with lower per capita spending perform better overall than schools with high per capita spending.
